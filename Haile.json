  "ingredient": "Five forms of Hyaluronic Acid: Work different layers of skin’s surface to hold water.-Ceramides: Oil-like molecules combine to support the skin barrier, helping to keep water in.-Vitamin B5: Works within the skin moisture barrier to maintain it.Aqua (Water), Sodium Hyaluronate, Propanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Phospholipids, Sphingolipids, Panthenol, Ahnfeltiopsis Concinna Extract, Glycerin, Polysorbate 20, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, P-Anisic Acid, Tocopherol, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethoxydiglycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hexylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.This new formula has a slight yellow tinge when compared to our previous formula due to the addition of a ceramide blend. This is the natural colour of this new raw material.This formulation contains 5 types of hyaluronic acid, pro-vitamin B5 and ceramides.Ceramides:To lock in moisture and support the skin barrier, ensuring long-term hydration. Ceramides (a natural lipid found in the skin) enhance the barrier's ability to protect and hydrate and ensure that moisture is locked in for longer-term results.5 Types of Hyaluronic Acid:5 types of hyaluronic acid provide hydration to multiple layers of the skin. These include low-, medium-, and high-molecular-weight molecules, a hyaluronic acid crosspolymer, and hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid. These ingredients work together to help the skin retain moisture, re-plump dry, dehydrated areas, and improve skin suppleness.Pro-vitamin B5 (Panthenol):Supports the formation of essential skin barrier components like ceramides and fatty acids, further improving the skin's moisture retention and an overall healthy appearance.",
  "How to Use": "Suggested Usage:Apply a few drops to the face in the morning and evening.If irritation occurs, rinse off, cease use, and consult a physician.Use only as directed on unbroken skin.Patch testing prior to use is advised.Keep out of reach of children.Tip: Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 and Squalane + Amino Acids Lip balm can be used together to hydrate and plump the lips. Apply 1-2 drops of Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 on lips and follow with Squalane + Amino Acids Lip balm on top.Wet vs Dry Skin Use: Applying Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 on wet or dry skin does not impact it’s efficacy, contrary to some people’s belief that HA should be applied on wet skin for best results. Applying a moisturizer on top is the key to getter better hydration results from Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5.",

I could tell when I went to wash my face — I could still feel the product's texture sitting on the surface (and I do apply it properly, as instructed). I agree with others who’ve mentioned it feels a bit sticky as it dries down. I also noticed the product peels around my eyebrow area, which has never happened when using other hyaluronic acids and only experienced it with this one. I didn't face any irritations or breakouts I have combo skin but felt like this made it feel a bit more oily and gross throughout the day - I wouldn't repurchase again.",

I had really struggled with keeping a good moister barrier with skin with clogged pores, it for sure helped me with the dryness and restoring my skin barrier. I also even use it after I shower my mixing it with my moisturizer!! It helps my skin be buttery soft. Lastly it doesn’t smell or make me break out. However I have a tip, use on damp skin so it absorbs moister. As well as doing three drops twice a day. (On the fore head and both cheeks). The photos are a before and after, I also use other active acne ingredients however the hydraulic acid for sure keeps my skin moisturized. Hoped this helped!!",

      "description": "I’ve been using the Laneige Milk Toner for a few weeks now, and I’m genuinely impressed! The texture is lightweight yet feels creamy and nourishing — just like its name suggests. It absorbs quickly into the skin without leaving any sticky residue, which I absolutely love. My skin feels noticeably softer and smoother after each use, and it provides a nice boost of hydration that lasts throughout the day. It’s gentle enough that it didn’t irritate my sensitive skin, and it actually helped calm some redness I occasionally get. Plus, the subtle milky scent is refreshing without being overpowering. Overall, it’s a great toner if you’re looking for something soothing and moisturizing to prep your skin before serum or moisturizer. Laneige never disappoints, and this milk toner has definitely become a staple in my routine!",

It’s been severely stinging my skin upon application and my skin looks noticeably drier when I use it. By the end of the day my skin has clear dry flakes and feels scratchy—which doesn’t happen even if I use basic drugstore moisturiser or no moisturiser at all instead. Not sure if they switched up ingredients or the quality has just gone downhill, but either way this stuff isn’t cheap so that shouldn’t happen. Used to be my go to for under makeup, can’t recommend it anymore though. My skin instantly improved when I took it out of my routine, and trust me I tried a lot of different things to make sure it was the moisturiser causing the issues because I used to love it so much! I’m sad. :(",

The Glow Oil comes out in the summer when I want a bit of shine to my arms and legs without feeling greasy. Triple Prep (the old Superscreen) is my daily moisturizer in the colder months. Since I don't use moisturizer in the summer (because I am an extra greasy girlie) the Unseen Sunscreen has been my go to facial suncreen for years. No white cast on my brown skin, no greasy/oily face 45 minutes post application and no breakouts on my sensitive skin. After the formula change to the old Superscreen gave me a horrible reaction, I switched to the Triple Prep and it has been fine. I was nervous about the Unseen Sunscreen formula change but, thankfully, it hasn't caused any reactions. It does however leave my face greasier than the previous version. It's expensive but the bottle does last a while as a little bit goes a long way.",

Also the reviews are all gone from years ago and now you’ll see how this very old product somehow only has 400 reviews and most of them are incentivized. Please do not trust those, only trust the verified purchases and reviews!!!",

      "description": "Okay, before writing this gifted review, I want to say I had already been using this product for a few weeks (purchased with my own money) so this review is 100% honest! Over the past year or so, I started noticing random small bumps on my skin that just wouldn’t go away, no matter how much AHA/BHA exfoliation, expensive skincare, or even Adapalene I used. Eventually, I decided to give Azelaic Acid a try but wanted something budget-friendly, and that’s when I found this one from The Ordinary. Not even kidding! Within just FIVE days of using it daily, I started seeing the bumps disappear and my skin felt calmer and less irritated. A few days later, I added vitamin C into the mix and the combo works like magic! My skin is noticeably smoother and brighter now. I didn’t have any issues with pilling btw. The key is to layer your products properly and start with the most liquidy textures first and work your way up to the thicker ones, letting each one absorb fully before moving on. This has a pretty thick consistency, but honestly, a little goes a long way! I absolutely love it. It’s become a staple in my routine!",

This stuff changed EVERYTHING. My new routine is this, niacinimide and the skin fix moisturizer. My skin has not looked this good in years. I am super sensitive and prone to breaking out with new things, so it was a leap of faith to try these products. WORTH IT. Try it. So inexpensive and so so effective. I never write reviews, but felt this had to be shared with someone who needs to hear it!",

I just thought that with it supposed to “reinforce skin barrier” and “soothe + replenish skin” that it would help but it did not.

First thing, I was unfortunately allergic to an ingredient in this product. My skin itches and feels funny and I broke out in a rash on my neck after using it a couple of times in my day routine. 🫥. If you do have a reaction to it and it serves. Similar function in your routine go for it. Though 2) as a light weight serum, it absorbs beautifully into the skin and leaves like a bronzer glow. It’s perfect and looks really natural and even on my skin tone. But because it’s serum, I would have to layer it on twice as the rest of skin care step after serums would effectively rub off the product. 😑 I’m going to try the new tinted glow screen from Supergoop as it appears to solve both issues for me.",

The formula is exactly what I was looking for - not too thick or sticky but also not too thin like a lip oil. Super comfortable and hydrating. The amount of tint is exactly what I was looking for too. Sometimes I wear it on its own and it gives you just a nice pop of color but other times I use the Huda Beauty contour lip stains and then go over it with one of these and reapply as needed and it's fantastic! I honestly have no complaints and hope they come out with more colors. They smell so good too!",

About several days into using this product, my skin started showing a bit of raised red and itchy bumps on areas where I applied it. But it was not like a big scary angry rash, and also, it went away after taking 1-2 days break, so I continued to use it, because I loved the color so much. About a month later, the red irritated areas really started to show more profoundly, so I had to stop completely… It’s now been a week since I stopped using it, and fortunately, my skin has recovered back to its usual state. I would’ve continued to use it and give it a 5-star if my skin didn’t react.",

      "description": "This is the best hair product I’ve ever used hands down. I’ve had problem hair my entire life - baby fine and thin, oily, sensitive scalp, frizzy, uneven curl pattern and it’s only gotten worse with age because I’m now dealing with dryness and brittleness. I’ve relied on keratin for years just to not have to deal with it but I don’t like how stick straight and even more thin it makes my hair look. I’ve since let the keratin grow out and have been trying products with no luck until this product and I am truly impressed. A few spritz of this and the Dyson Airstraight and my hair becomes soft, manageable and has body in less than 10 minutes. It doesn’t make me greasy or weigh things down. I love the very light smell. This is a 100/10 product, I’m throwing everything else away and never looking back. Highly, highly recommended - only wish this came out years ago, would’ve saved me a lot of time, heartache, money and hair damage.",

      "description": "I really love this leave in conditioner. I have flat hair that's easily weighed down. I wash my hair every other day and use my Dyson to dry it. This works so well with a volume blowout and creates volume that is not sticky or heavy. It feels weightless but still provides a noticeable shine, softness, and gentle lift. I have already repurchased! I'm not giving it 5 stars because the first bottle only lasted 3 months, I don't like the smell, and the spray mechanism isn't my favourite, it's a \"continuous spray\" but I don't feel I have as much control over it as a traditional sprayer. Despite those things, I will probably continue to repurchase because finding a product that enhances volume and shine with no weigh down is difficult!",
